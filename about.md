The world is small - the Oswald's world is smaller!

Osvita & Osmond Oswald are the mini-me's of berlin based filmmaker couple Vio Jaeger & Gerrit Riessen.

Since spring 2020 you can follow the charming miniature duo on their stop-motion journey to the sweetest hidden spots on planet earth.


A sauna in an old Firetruck, the Fake-Elvis-Hotel-Room or the Russian Apartments where the Oswalds became the Oswalds.

This city guide in stop motion is a guide for people who don't like guides
and will definitely inspire you to see the world from a different angle.
