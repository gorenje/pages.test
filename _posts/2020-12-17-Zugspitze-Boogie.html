</p>

<p class='margin-top'>
Do armadillos ski? Yes They do!

But only on top of the highest mountain in Germany!

Texas musician James Steinle joined forces with Berlin based filmmaker duo „The Oswalds“ - aka Osvita and Osmond Oswald - For the music video of his new song „Zugspitze Boogie“.
</p><p class='margin-top'>

Adapting Steinlés lyrcis and the memories from his youth in southern Germany, The Oswalds turned the singer into a cartoon character and brought the little „Armadillo with the Cowboy Hat“ back to the Zugspitze, the highest mountain in Germany.

The simple bold images as well as the naive style of illustration and animation go hand in hand with the mood boosting melody and lyrics of Zugspitze Boogie. It will definitely make you wanna tap your toe, have a German beer and dance the zugspitze boogie all night long!
